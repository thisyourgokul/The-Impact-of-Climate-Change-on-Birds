# The-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Birds
Predict the impact of climate change on bird distributions using spatial data and machine learning.


Project Description:

Climate is changing around the world. This change is impacting species of wild animals. In this project, we will use four decades of bird sightings and climate data to predict the distribution of a bird species in the Scottish Highlands and see how its distribution changed over the years.
We will use data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and a subset of the UKCP09 climate data from the UK Met Office.


Project Tasks:

1. Tracking a changing climate
2. Mapping a changing climate
3. Fieldwork in the digital age – download the data
4. Sorting out the bad eggs – data cleaning
5. Nesting the data
6. Making things spatial - projecting our observations
7. Extract exactly what we want
8. Pseudo-absences
9. Making models - with caret
10. Prediction probabilities
11. A map says more than a thousand words
